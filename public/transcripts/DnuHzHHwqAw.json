You're never going to have your first beignet ever again."},{"timestamp":"00:19","text":"Pretty cool."},{"timestamp":"00:20","text":"-It's cool, right? You like it?\n-Mhm!"},{"timestamp":"00:22","text":"Hey what's up, guys. Welcome back to Binging with Babish"},{"timestamp":"00:24","text":"where this week, we're taking a look at the beignets featured in Chef from Café du Monde."},{"timestamp":"00:28","text":"I've got a box of their commercially available beignet mix here."},{"timestamp":"00:31","text":"I thought that'd be a good place to start"},{"timestamp":"00:33","text":"and then we can take a crack at making some of these suckers from scratch."},{"timestamp":"00:35","text":"We got to start by reading the directions on the box"},{"timestamp":"00:38","text":"which tell us to measure out two cups of the mix"},{"timestamp":"00:41","text":"into a large bowl and combine with seven ounces of room temperature water"},{"timestamp":"00:45","text":"So we're going to do as the box tells us and mix these guys together"},{"timestamp":"00:48","text":"until a shaggy ball of dough forms."},{"timestamp":"00:50","text":"Don't be worried if it's a little sticky."},{"timestamp":"00:51","text":"Beignet dough is sticky by nature."},{"timestamp":"00:54","text":"But we do want it to form a cohesive ball so we can turn it out onto a generously floured countertop."},{"timestamp":"00:58","text":"I'm talking \"Scrooge at the end of Christmas Carol\" generous."},{"timestamp":"01:01","text":"Plop out our dough. Make sure that it's lightly dusted on both sides with flour"},{"timestamp":"01:04","text":"and then roll it out to about a quarter-inch thickness."},{"timestamp":"01:06","text":"You don't have to, like, measure it or anything."},{"timestamp":"01:08","text":"This dough is pretty forgiving."},{"timestamp":"01:09","text":"Just roll it out so it's nice and thin"},{"timestamp":"01:11","text":"and trim off the edges so we can cut it into nice, uniform rectangles."},{"timestamp":"01:14","text":"You can use a knife here, but ideally you'd want to use a pizza cutter."},{"timestamp":"01:17","text":"It's going to give you cleaner, neater cuts that don't drag or stretch the dough."},{"timestamp":"01:20","text":"Ball up and roll out your scraps"},{"timestamp":"01:22","text":"and cut those into rectangles as well. Don't be wasteful."},{"timestamp":"01:24","text":"And then over on the stove, we've got two quarts of vegetable oil"},{"timestamp":"01:27","text":"heating to 368...369..."},{"timestamp":"01:30","text":"370 de–"},{"timestamp":"01:31","text":"Oh"},{"timestamp":"01:32","text":"Close enough."},{"timestamp":"01:32","text":"If you don't have a digital thermometer, go get one."},{"timestamp":"01:34","text":"But if you doggedly refuse to, you can tell if your oil's hot enough if your beignets"},{"timestamp":"01:39","text":"pop up after about five seconds."},{"timestamp":"01:41","text":"We want these to brown as evenly as possible"},{"timestamp":"01:42","text":"so we're going to baste their \nskyward-facing side with oil"},{"timestamp":"01:45","text":"continually for the first two minutes that these guys are in the fryer"},{"timestamp":"01:48","text":"and then we're gonna give 'em a flip, let 'em cook for another thirty or so more seconds"},{"timestamp":"01:52","text":"until they are golden brown and crisp."},{"timestamp":"01:54","text":"Evacuate them onto a paper towel lined plate"},{"timestamp":"01:56","text":"Let 'em drain for a few minutes before dusting them liberally with powdered sugar"},{"timestamp":"02:00","text":"I'm talking Alexandria Ocasio Cortez liberal \n*fire reference*"},{"timestamp":"02:02","text":"Because beignets derive most of their sweetness"},{"timestamp":"02:04","text":"from the mountains of sugar they are be-dusted with."},{"timestamp":"02:06","text":"Now, these are pretty good, but as you can see"},{"timestamp":"02:08","text":"they're pretty thin, and they're not soft and fluffy"},{"timestamp":"02:11","text":"and they certainly don't make me feel like donning my best linen suit"},{"timestamp":"02:14","text":"and ordering up a...cloudy snifter of absinthe."},{"timestamp":"02:17","text":"So we're gonna take a crack at making some of these things from scratch."},{"timestamp":"02:19","text":"We're gonna start with buttermilk, a cup and a half of it"},{"timestamp":"02:22","text":"to which we're going to add a half a cup of boiling milk"},{"timestamp":"02:25","text":"making a tepid mixture perfect"},{"timestamp":"02:26","text":"for allowing our four teaspoons of dry yeast to bloom."},{"timestamp":"02:30","text":"And just to encourage their feeding frenzy"},{"timestamp":"02:32","text":"we're going to add our sugar (two and a half tablespoons worth)"},{"timestamp":"02:34","text":"and we're going to give that a good mix"},{"timestamp":"02:35","text":"Don't be afraid to deploy your adorable little whisk."},{"timestamp":"02:37","text":"*that'swhatshesaid*"},{"timestamp":"02:38","text":"Set that aside for ten minutes, during which time"},{"timestamp":"02:40","text":"we're going to assemble our dry ingredients."},{"timestamp":"02:42","text":"We're going to start with 22 ounces of bread flour"},{"timestamp":"02:45","text":"to which we're going to add a half teaspoon each"},{"timestamp":"02:47","text":"of baking soda and kosher salt."},{"timestamp":"02:49","text":"I was skeptical about using bread flour at first"},{"timestamp":"02:51","text":"but I think it ended up making the beignets nice and chewy, which is what we're after."},{"timestamp":"02:55","text":"So we're going to mix those together and then add our milky, yeasty, sugary concoction"},{"timestamp":"02:59","text":"Drop down our dough hook and mix for about 3-4 minutes"},{"timestamp":"03:02","text":"until a massive dough forms that begins to pull away"},{"timestamp":"03:05","text":"from the sides of the bowl, but is still a big sticky mess."},{"timestamp":"03:08","text":"Try to resist adding flour,\nunless it's really really super wet"},{"timestamp":"03:11","text":"But you want it to look just like this"},{"timestamp":"03:12","text":"a nice sticky situation."},{"timestamp":"03:14","text":"We're going to pull everything down off the dough hook"},{"timestamp":"03:16","text":"cover and let rest for one hour"},{"timestamp":"03:18","text":"during which time, it's going to double up in size."},{"timestamp":"03:21","text":"Wow!"},{"timestamp":"03:21","text":"It should be less sticky and more tacky at this point"},{"timestamp":"03:24","text":"but it's still plenty sticky, so we're going \nto flour our work surface"},{"timestamp":"03:27","text":"with unbridled enthusiasm."},{"timestamp":"03:28","text":"Turn out the dough with a bowl scraper if you've got one"},{"timestamp":"03:31","text":"and before it gets the chance to stick to the table"},{"timestamp":"03:33","text":"we're going to coat it with a nice thicc layer of flour"},{"timestamp":"03:35","text":"that's going to create the perfect consistency in our dough once we've rolled it out"},{"timestamp":"03:39","text":"which we're going to do next."},{"timestamp":"03:40","text":"Roll it out to the same thickness as before"},{"timestamp":"03:42","text":"trim the edges as before, \nand cut into rectangles as before."},{"timestamp":"03:46","text":"We've still got our oil preheated to 370°F"},{"timestamp":"03:49","text":"into which we're going to deposit our donuts"},{"timestamp":"03:51","text":"and immediately you can see that these are puffing up"},{"timestamp":"03:53","text":"in a way more significant and exciting way \nthan our last batch."},{"timestamp":"03:56","text":"We're cooking them for about the same amount of time on each side"},{"timestamp":"03:58","text":"draining them on paper towels and dusting them down"},{"timestamp":"04:01","text":"with lots and lots of powdered sugar."},{"timestamp":"04:03","text":"Now these are the beignets that I was looking for."},{"timestamp":"04:05","text":"I'm not going to say that they were \nas good as Café du Monde"},{"timestamp":"04:07","text":"but they were damn close."},{"timestamp":"04:08","text":"As my neighbor said, they are \ncrunchy, squeezy, and soft"},{"timestamp":"04:11","text":"three of the finest descriptors I could have asked for."},{"timestamp":"04:13","text":"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hit the StairMaster."}]
